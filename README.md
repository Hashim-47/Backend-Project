## Setup

In order to access the necessary environmental variables you must create a .env.test file as well as a .env.development file. Add the following text (PGDATABASE=nc_news_test) in the .env.test file and then add (PGDATABASE=nc_news) to the .env.development file. This will ensure you can successfully connect to the two datbases locally.
